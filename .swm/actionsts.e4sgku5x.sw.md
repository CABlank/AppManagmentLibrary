### Actions.ts

This file defines the actions that can be dispatched to the store to update the state. Each action represents an operation that can modify the state, such as adding a new task, updating an existing task, or deleting a task. Actions typically include:

- **Action Creators**: Functions that return action objects. Each action object should have a type (describing the action) and a payload (the data needed to perform the action).

- **Thunk Actions**: If your library supports asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching tasks from an API), you might include thunk actions or similar patterns to handle these processes.
