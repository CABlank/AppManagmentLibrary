This file implements the central state management class, often referred to as a "store." It should be responsible for holding the application's state, updating it, and notifying subscribers about changes. Key functionalities include:

- **Initialization**: Constructing the store with an initial state.

- **State Access**: Providing a method to access the current state.

- **State Update**: Implementing a method to update the state based on actions dispatched to the store.

- **Subscription Management**: Allowing components to subscribe to state changes and be notified when updates occur, so they can re-render or react accordingly.
