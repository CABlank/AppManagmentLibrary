title: Project Scope Document for AppManagmentLibrary
---
#### Introduction

**Purpose**: This document outlines the scope for a custom library developed in TypeScript, designed to facilitate state management and UI rendering within a task management application. This library aims to offer developers an intuitive and scalable approach to implement a data-driven architecture, focusing on task-related functionalities.

#### Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To create a lightweight, TypeScript-based library that simplifies state management and UI rendering for developers building task management applications.

- **Success Criteria**: The development of a library that:

  - Offers a straightforward TypeScript API for defining, initializing, and updating the task-related state.

  - Enables automated and dynamic UI rendering in response to state changes.

  - Implements essential (Create, Update, Delete) operations for managing tasks.

#### Features and Functionality

- **State Structure Definition**: Tools to define a structured state model tailored for task management, including interfaces for tasks, categories, priorities, and completion statuses.

- **State Initialization**: Functionality to initialize the application's state, supporting both static initial states and dynamic loading from external APIs or local storage.

- **Dynamic UI Rendering**: A system that dynamically renders tasks and task lists based on the current application state, ensuring the UI always reflects the latest task statuses and updates.

- **Event-Driven Updates**: Streamlined handling of user interactions, such as adding a new task or marking a task as complete, which automatically updates the state and triggers relevant UI component refreshes.

- **Efficient State and UI Management**: Optimizations for minimal and efficient state mutations and selective UI updates to maintain high performance, especially with extensive task lists.

#### Technical Requirements

- **Languages**: Developed using TypeScript for strong typing and compile-time checks, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

- **Compatibility**: The library will be transpiled to ES5/ES6 JavaScript for broad compatibility with modern web browsers.

- **Storage**: Capabilities for utilizing browser storage (e.g., `localStorage`) to persist task data between sessions, enhancing user experience.

#### Limitations and Exclusions

- **Complex Project Management Features**: Initial versions will prioritize foundational task management and simple list functionalities, excluding more complex project management features like Gantt charts or extensive team collaboration tools.

- **Server-Side Integration**: While the initial focus is on client-side functionality, direct integration with server-side technologies and synchronization features may be explored in future releases.

#### Packaging and Distribution

- **npm Packaging**: The library will be packaged and made available as an installable npm package, facilitating easy integration into existing JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

- **Documentation and Examples**: Comprehensive documentation, including API guides and example usage, will be provided, ensuring developers can quickly leverage the library in their projects.
